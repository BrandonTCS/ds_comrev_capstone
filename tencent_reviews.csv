","- China 996 culture.
- Chinese tech companies management are more focused on overall group conformity then individual career growth and progression.
- Also if you are not chinese speaking, you will generally lose out due to the main counterparts are in china. 
- Tencent is attempting to branch out globally , however their culture which mainly stem from the china 996 culture will be a big shock to people who are mainly westernized.
Advice to Management
Don't lift and shift whatever management style that worked in China to the global market. Adapt it to the global market or you will just be making 1 step forward 2 steps back in progress.

 Corporate Functions,Singapore,1 Apr 2022 ,Balanced View,"1) This may be surprising but I'm having adequate WLB - Bosses are flexible, colleagues are supportive - End of the day, it's an output driven company - Work smart and deliver results, you can plan how your schedule goes.

2) Culture is great, there are team bonding budgets for team planned activities, social activity clubs for people to participate outside of work (running club / badminton club etc)

3) It's always about looking to be better, faster and of higher quality - The company is relentless in its pursuit of excellence which is why they have grown to what they are today

4) I was blessed with great team managers, through them I felt empowered and they had often pushed me to do better - Again, this is all in the mindset, do you perceive feedback as constructive or criticism?

5) Compensation is competitive but when is money ever enough?
","1) Systems are not the best, unintuitive and often fragmented - You will need to be versatile in finding alternative ways to track your own work processes and deliverables

2) Ambiguity is really for breakfast, lunch and dinner - If you enjoy solving problems as they come and not having a dull day, this will be great

3) Structure is more business group driven as opposed to a regional format, might take some adjusting of mindsets to get used to the matrixed environment

4) Market share in some business groups may not be great but that presents opportunities to make things happen

5) Pros mentioned above might vary from team to team, it still largely depends on the team's leadership and style - so please do your own due diligence during the interview process
Advice to Management
Generally, it was a positive experience for me and I've enjoyed myself working in Tencent. I had a very different perspective (positive one) from what you hear in the market about China HQ Tech companies. They are trying to do good and I hope they continue on the momentum.

Perhaps in order for work to be even more efficient, my recommendation is to move into a regional model with an overarching GM managing across business groups rather than siloed business groups - With that being said, there are complexities which may not be visible to me so I may not always know best.

- as I came from another fast-growing Chinese Tech Company, I can say that not all Chinese tech companies are the same category. Tencent Singapore definitely demonstrated their values and truly care for it's employees, at least for my team
- Though my manager is based at Shenzhen HQ, there's no challenge in communicating across the region and my manager understand the importance of Work Life Balance in Singapore
- 996 is NOT valid in Singapore office
- as a recruiter, I get to work on many pioneer roles and for the exciting fast growing business, which is EXCITING!
- almost everyone is very friendly and approachable so far
- overall great attractive remuneration
","- too bad we can't really work in office and meet with other colleagues due to covid period
- doesn't have 'own office' like Google yet, but the shared office for now is very comfortable too 
- the tech system internally is not the best and many areas for improvements but not a major concern
- the overall perks and benefits can continue to improve
Advice to Management
pls continue to stay competitive by improving on the perks and benefits!

 Project Manager,"Palo Alto, CA",28 Apr 2021 ,Will not recommend unless desperate for visa sponsorship,"stable paychecks and benefit, Tencent will not go anywhere in years
","- Poor WLB, a lot of political games, culture shocks. 
- (not applicable to locals but for visa seekers) Will be paid heavily under market especially for non-engineer positions;
- all the issues of a Chinese company's oversea office you can image of.

 Game Designer,"Shenzhen, Guangdong",5 May 2021 ,"Overall good, but...","1. Good salary and working environment. 
2. Good employer reputation in China.
3. Has a great trainee program for junior game designers.
","1. Bad WLB. Need to work overtime almost every day.

2. Forced ranking system to punish (bonus cuts or even dismission) employees who ranked low. No matter employees' actual performance, about 10-20% of them need to be marked as ""need to improve"" or ""unsatisfied"" forcibly based on the system. If everyone in your team works hard, that will be a tragedy.

3. Limited experience in game design know-how and methodology. It is ok in the past, but crucial and lethal when Tencent wants to produce AAA titles to expand the global market.

4. Impatient managers. They expect developers to effectively produce and iterate content with superior quality (ideally to finish a AAA quality game in a year) but leave limited time. If the test data of your game is non-ideal, they will cut your project unhesitatingly.

5. Unfriendly for international employees.

 Recruiter,"Los Angeles, CA",8 Feb 2021 ,Better Than Expected,"Hours: It's like at university. Most of your time is free period where you can control your work hours. No one expects you to be on the dot at 9am if there's no meeting. As long as you communicate with your team on project needs, your hours are yours to dictate. If anyone complains about OT, it's usually voluntary because they want to put more effort into their project.

Culture: Very open-minded colleagues. They're usually bilingual or multilingual, so they understand various perspectives from different cultures. My manager and colleagues frequently ask for my opinion on various things, regardless of seniority. I can speak my mind, as long as I say it in a way that's appropriate for the given audience (i.e. colleague my level vs hiring manager). Trust me, it's fun to hear 2 languages going on throughout a single meeting. It makes you feel like you're truly working for an MNC. Also, the people are honest and have a high sense of integrity. They're transparent about their intentions, want to protect their colleagues like family, and help them grow career-wise.

Management: They try to put me on challenging projects that highlight my strengths and don't rely too much on my weaknesses.

Compensation: Generous + the red packet culture
","If you're working directly with the HQ, and have never worked for a Chinese company before, there may be the normal culture shock and language barrier. If you work closely with the HQ, then you need to understand that high-context communication style, as opposed to direct communication style in American companies.
Advice to Management
Put more effort into branding outside of China so that people don't keep listening to false rumors or biased English news.
