","Job scope narrow, lots of people doing similar roles, limited scope for innovation if you are not based at HQ. Some truly horrible people in very senior leadership roles who make life miserable for their organisations but everyone is too afraid to say anything. Easy to grow in the early stages of career - extremely difficult as you head towards Director level. Lots of senior leaders have their fiefdoms and 'friends' whom they take care of at the expense of other talent. Politics are hideous

Pros

Cons
Slow career progression and lack of opportunities to move fast and innovate.
Advice to Management
The company should strike a better balance. The ""people-first"" mindset does makes low performers comfortable (resting and vesting) and sacrifices strong performers who struggle to find opportunities and leave. In the medium-long term this cannot benefit the Company.

Yes we welcome you with open arms! // 

// any objection to this statement ask your hiring team what Data Systems they use in house, forget real time, theres not even one that works and you'll be pointed to multiple sources and links ? Google Cloud can't even make its dog food edible, what a load of AI nonsense //

Seriously and ex Oracle boss to build up a Cloud Business? Oracle is hated by all execs in the industry, its a the T-Rex that survives by ravaging its customers, I don't get it, what am I missing? 

The industry analyst will sing, your partners are going to dance, your customer will be blinded and perhaps GCP will become a big revenue contributor to Google - perhaps. Make sure the money and investments continue, soon as the wine runs out everyone wakes up with a bad hangover. And that is the truth

Advice to Management
Keep up the great work. Vision of individual department fits into overall company vision as well individual contribution. It terms of clarity, Google is clear about expectations.
In terms of progressions, it depends on the department. Majority of staff switch to other departments so they could climb to the next career ladder, and this is normal at Google.

Anonymous,Singapore,21 May 2019 ,Great Opportunities; Lesser Job Satisfaction,"I shall not touch on the benefits as I think these are over discussed and obvious. What I love about the company is the amalgamation of great minds, collaborative work, amazing opportunities (both work and personal), flat structure, continual education and the freedom to do your work as you seem fit without having to adhere to strict processes and protocols.
","- Your core job is mundane as they tend to hire over qualified people
- They tend to promote unqualified middle managers. I have had met teams where the subordinates are much more knowledgeable and capable than the managers. This, many times made them lose great people.
- What you put hard work on might not materialize to fruition in the future as change is constant. Projects get scrapped all the time. In the end, you feel like you don't achieve much at all.
- Feels like a cult. When you work at Google, you live and breathe Google.
- Distracting work environment with so many going-ons, travels, open office, etc; hard to do work if you are not focused. 
- While they promote work life balance, the truth is, this is hard to have since there are so many projects, changes, travels and filtering of information to have a decent work life balance 
- Ridiculous amounts of unnecessary meetings
Advice to Management
You have great people but really bad managers. You need to revisit at how you promote middle managers and directors and not just those who are visible.

 Software Engineer,,15 Sept 2018 ,Steadily going downhill,"- Great salary
- Great benefits
- Generally competent engineers
- Culture of helpfulness and quality in many engineering teams. Most engineers will answer your email and give you advice. 
- Can still find interesting technical work, though there's lots of dull work too, especially if you're more junior.
","- PR-speak is widespread. Executives use vague CYA communication style. To me it's like hearing politicians talk. Transparency has been steadily going down for years, you hear about projects when they're announced or leaked.
- Several high-level execs seem to have a pretty weak ethical compass. Increasing number of ethical scandals, antitrust fines, etc. Internal explanation often weak and unconvincing around these issues.
- Lots of talk of being data driven but what's common is data being used to justify whatever fits data slinger's narrative, including for myopic goal setting that results in adverse second and third order effects (see Goodhart's law). 
- Increasing attitude of engineers just doing whatever they're told, forget the ""do the right thing"" of old times. 
- Project and product churn. Google products are often unfinished and buggy, UIs changing all the time. Lots of talk of rewarding product excellence but lots of cynicism about it (I don't buy it, I don't see the products getting better). Product managers compete to launch features; engineers have increasingly less power to make product decisions.
- If you're more senior you might get pushed to do management, the old days of having a technical individual career option seems over in many teams, at least if you want to get promoted.
- Internal frameworks tend to be overengineered and complex because of many disparate use cases and legacy, easy things take a long time as a result. Critical internal tools can be unstaffed while projects that go nowhere (how many chat apps?) can have massive headcount.
- Crowded noisy open floor offices, with little privacy. I heard some folks outside engineering don't even get a fixed desk anymore.
- AI seems much more important than privacy. Products and strategy seem aligned with getting Google more and more data. Privacy unfriendly defaults, UIs, etc. Might make you uncomfortable if you work on a consumer product.

","When I joined Google 7 years ago, I used to be amazed at people and culture every day. Over the time as the company grows to a large corporate with more hierarchy and corporate politics and most of founding management left, it's now just a normal company with corporate double talks and lack of transparency from management. People and culture are still better than most companies but not amazing any longer.
Also company wide issue is detaching from work. Over many years here, I've never seen a college doing well without doing overtime (might be possible in a large operational team though). People may leave the office early but will dial back in to work at night. It was okay when I was single but not when I need family time with 2 small kids. Burn outs are quite common as the performance evaluation is based on comparison to your peers who are bright talents and work 24/7.

Pros
Amazing people who are really talented and bright, loads of employee benefits
Cons
Career development is virtually impossible if you come into the company at senior level. Far too Mountain View centric in recent years - need a more global perspective. Difficult to grow careers after middle management unless you are prepared to move to HQ in the US
Advice to Management
#1 Promote internal senior people into senior roles - don't make the development process so difficult that it becomes a disincentive for hiring managers to develop their senior people. It shouldn't be easier to hire senior people in from outside! You are losing amazing senior leaders.
#2 Create opportunities for staff outside of Mountain View. Hire from your regions - i.e. Leaders with EMEA experience in EMEA, leaders with APAC experience in APAC. Please stop putting random British/American guys into senior leadership roles around the world when they lack the cultural and language skills - grow your local talent.
#3 Understand that people leadership is much more important that functional expertise in senior roles. There are too many 'experts' in senior roles who lack EQ, people management skills and compassion. 
#Need more effort to dismantle the 'boys club'

","I work at YouTube. It is run like an army camp. Instructions come from top management which have not been well thought through but need to be obeyed, the caliber of some folks in senior management (esp. in functional support teams) is mediocre, protectionism (some folks incl. seniors still there and move ahead because they are protected by their seniors), 360 degree feedback is non existent i.e. promotions are at the whims and fancies of what 1 person perceives/thinks i.e. manager (no collective inputs taken from different stakeholders), territorial wars being fought inside partner management teams, megalomaniacal leadership, complete dismantling of meritocracy (faster promos if you sit in US)......the list goes on and on
Advice to Management
You are just riding on the Google brand. If YouTube was a standalone company, most talented folks would have left. Your employees are unhappy but don't speak up since they want to remain at Google, your partners are unhappy because you cant sell well, the product sucks (comments are the worst, discovery is second worst, you have not innovated anything significant). Revive a culture of meritocracy and innovation.

 Program Manager,"Mountain View, CA",21 Jun 2013 ,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable","1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).
","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(
Advice to Management
1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management. 

2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done; what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed? 

3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment.

 Software Engineer III,"New York, NY",10 May 2014 ,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.
","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.

 Software Engineer,,5 May 2022 ,"Still an amazing place to work, beware of entitlement","1. Great work/life balance. There's not many companies I know that have a consistent a 40hr work week, and pay top salary.
2. Cool projects to work on. Good balance between research & development. (See caveats below though.)
3. Supportive, healthy, psychologically safe work environment. Google cares a ton about how we work, and how we work together. The bottom-up culture also means that we have a lot of self-determination and don't feel like we're at the mercy of our management.
4. Super easy internal mobility. Lots of us change teams every couple of years. Google has so many different types of work that you won't feel you're ""stuck"" -- as long as you like working at Google overall, then you'll be able to find something interesting.
5. It's Google! Having Google on your resume opens doors to other opportunities, and it's great for networking too since generally your colleagues will be top of their field.
","1. Entitlement. I make literally 5x as much as I ever dreamt. The comp is insane at FAANG companies like Google. But people here constantly complain about salary, the quality of the free food, why they have to work 5 days a week.... these are sometimes the same people who work 20 hrs a week. The amount of entitlement is insane here -- yes, we're the best of the best and we deserve a lot. But the culture and perks tend to pamper us.

2. Not all teams and projects have fulfilling work. There's lots of options, but choose carefully. Maybe you're happy getting paid to do nothing, on a team that has no visibility, so that you can ""rest and vest"" and coast. But, this will leave you woefully unprepared for your next job.... any company will hire you after Google, but that doesn't mean you'll do well at any company, particularly if you go to a more fast paced environment.
