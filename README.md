Credit to Matthew Chatham for glassdoor scraper to extract the employee reviews. Some updates has been made to the orginal scraper due to changes in Glassdoor codes over the years.

The data is scraped from glassdoor to get actual reviews from existing and past employees from the companies on their reviews of the company. Through the reviews, benefial insights such as common words regarding the pros and cons of the companies can be extracted to better inform the companies on areas that they are doing well and areas that they could improve on. This will server as a external check if the company is running well and be alerted should there be any major issues that could have been missed out during internal check and balane.
